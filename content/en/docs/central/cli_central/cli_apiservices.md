description: Learn how your DevOps process can use Axway Central CLI to build
  and manage API services in your environments.
---

## Before you start

* You must [authorize your DevOps service to use the DevOps API](/docs/central/cli_central/cli_install/#authorize-your-cli-to-use-the-amplify-central-apis)
* Verify the @axway/amplify-central-cli version is at minimum 0.1.3.

## Objectives

Learn how to create and manage your API services to represent your distributed cloud and on-premise environments using the Axway Central CLI.

* Create a new API service in an environment
* Retrieve a list of all API services in an environment
* Retrieve details for a specific API service
* Update a specific API service
* Delete a specific API service

## Create an API service in your environment

An API service represents an API, including all its versions and deployed endpoints, and additional information to represent your API, for example, description, environment scope, image encoded in base64.

To automate the creation of an API service in your environment:

1. Create an environment by providing the environment name argument, for example, `env1`:

    ```
    axway central create env env1
    ```

2. Create an API service within environment `env1` by providing a path to a valid .yaml, .yml, or .json file that defines a specific resource (for example, `apiservice.yaml`).  In this example, only one API service called `apisvc1` is created from the resource file:

    ```
    axway central create -f <filepath>
    ```

Try out this procedure using the [apiservice.json](https://axway-open-docs.netlify.app/samples/central/apiservice.json) or [apiservice.yaml](https://axway-open-docs.netlify.app/samples/central/apiservice.yaml) samples.

## Retrieve a list of API services

Get a list of all API services in all environments:

```
axway central get apiservices
```

Alternatively, you can use the short name, `apis`:

```
axway central get apis
```

This command outputs a list of all API services in all environments, with information about the API service name, age, title, and environment scope:

```
NAME                                  AGE           TITLE                   RESOURCE KIND  SCOPE KIND   SCOPE NAME

```

To get help with a list of supported resource types, run:

```
axway central get
```

This command outputs a table of supported resources, along with their resource kinds and short names:

```
The server supports the following resources:

## Retrieve details of a specific API Service

Get the details of a specific API service in an environment by providing the environment name and the API service name:

```
axway central get apisvc <name> --scope env1 -o yaml  # Get API service <name> details of `env1` in YAML format
```

This command outputs the details of that specific service in YAML format:

```
---
group: management
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: APIService
name: apisvc1
title: apisvc1 title
metadata:
  id: e4e540a975678cb901757ae1436562c2
  audit:

  scope:
    id: e4e87a1675678dc001757ae1417d483b
    kind: Environment
    name: env1
    selfLink: /management/v1alpha1/environments/env1
  resourceVersion: '46171'
  references: []
  selfLink: /management/v1alpha1/environments/env1/apiservices/apisvc1
attributes:
  createdBy: yaml
finalizers: []
tags:

  - cli
  - axway
spec:

---
```

To output the information in JSON format, change the `-o` flag from YAML to JSON:

```
axway central get apisvc <name> -s env1 -o json       # Get API service <name> details of `env1` in JSON format
```

## Update a specific API Service

Update the details of a specific API service by providing a path to the configuration file:

```
axway central apply -f apiservice.yaml   # Update API service in YAML format
```

```
axway central apply -f apiservice.json   # Update API service in JSON format
```

## Delete a specific API Service in an environment

This action will delete all API services and resources in the environment specified. The CLI command can take a few seconds to finish depending on the number of resources represented in the environment.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning"%}}This action cannot be reversed.{{% /alert %}}

To delete a specific API service in an environment, provide a path to the configuration file:

```
axway central delete -f apiservice.yaml   # Delete an API service using a file in YAML format
```

```
axway central delete -f apiservice.json   # Delete an API service using a file in JSON format
```

Use `--wait` to delete an API service using a YAML file while waiting for resource deletion confirmation. The `--wait` option will check for resource deletion for up to 10 seconds.

```
axway central delete -f apiservice.yaml --wait
```

Use `--scope` to delete an API service within the scope of and environment named env1.

```
axway central delete apiservice apisvc1 -scope env1 --wait
```
