## Add an endpoint to API service

Before adding an endpoint, you must [add a service](/docs/central/env_gw_mgmt/add_api_service).

1. From the details page of your service, click the (+ Add Endpoint) button located at the top right of the **Endpoints** tab.
2. Enter information about your API service endpoint:
    * **Protocol**: The transfer protocol used by the API service.
    * **Host**: The domain name or IP address of the API service.
    * **Port**: The port number where the API service is exposed.
    * **Basepath**: The path relative to the host where the API service is deployed.
3. Click **Add and save** to add the endpoint, you can repeat steps 2 and 3 to add more endpoints.
4. Click **Save** to create the endpoint(s).

> If you want to add an endpoint to an API service using the Axway Central CLI, please refer to these [docs](/docs/central/cli_central/cli_publish) instead.

The error may contain references to objects only found when using the CLI or API directly. In this case, please refer to the [Axway CLI](/docs/central/cli_central/cli_publish) documentation for further guidance.
