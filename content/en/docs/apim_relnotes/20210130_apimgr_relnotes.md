## Summary

API Gateway is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in Docker containers. API Manager is a licensed product running on top of API Gateway, and has the same deployment options as API Gateway.

The software installation is available on Linux. For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

Docker deployment is supported on Linux. For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

## New features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements are available in this update.

### Option to disable SSL renegotiation is added for HTTPS listeners and Connection filters

We have added a new option, **Disable renegotiation in TLSv1.2 and earlier**, in Policy Studio to allow you to disable SSL renegotiation when configuring HTTPS interfaces or connecting to URL filters. This option is enabled by default, meaning that renegotiation is not allowed, and listeners do not send HelloRequest messages, and they ignore renegotiation requests via ClientHello.

For more information, see:

* [Configure Advanced SSL settings](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_gw_instances/general_services/#configure-advanced-ssl-settings)
* [Connect to URL filter](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_polref/routing_common/)

## Update a container deployment

They must be upgraded the same way, regardless of whether they are API Manager enabled or not.
